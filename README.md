### Automated Method for Processing and Analyzing Wetting Test Paper Video Records

#### Abstract
This final report provides a comprehensive overview of the research project focused on developing an automated method for processing and analyzing wetting test paper video records. The method involves image processing techniques to extract relevant information about the wetting conditions of the paper from video records.

#### Introduction
In recent years, paper-based tests have found widespread applications across various fields. This section aims to propose an automated method for extracting relevant information about the wetting conditions of the paper from video records. We employ image processing techniques, including median blur, Gaussian blur, HSV filter adjustments, binary thresholding, and Canny edge detection, to process the video.

#### UI Designs
**UI Layout of Video Processor**
- **Description:** Displays the UI layout for processing wetting test paper videos.
- **Features:** Play/pause functionality, HSV filter adjustment sliders, real-time result display, display mode control, image processing sliders, confirmation button.

#### Methods
**Multifunctional Video Processor for Wetting Test Paper**
- **Description:** Implements user-adjustable HSV filter, binary threshold, Canny edge detection for test paper analysis.
- **Methods:** HSV filter, binary thresholding, Canny edge detection, median blur, Gaussian blur.
- **Limitations:** Unstable lighting affects accuracy.
